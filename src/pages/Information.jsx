            RateMyProf is a space to share those answers.

          <p>
            RateMyProf is an independent student project inspired by campus life
            at NIT Warangal. The React frontend is connected to a Node.js,
            Express, and MySQL backend for catalog management and account
            registration and login. Professor seed profiles are fictional
            examples. Courses come from the NITW CSE curriculum, and reviews
            start empty. The project is not affiliated with or endorsed by the
            institution.
